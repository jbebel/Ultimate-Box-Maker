# Summary

<img src="http://heartygfx.free.fr/Thingiverse/Update.jpg">
The file include now the Panel Maker.
Check below in the <strong><font color="Grey">Experimental area</font></strong> to download it.
<br>
My first try with OpenScad,
the box is fully customizable.
I hope you will enjoy with it, and will show us many boxes made with.

If you play with the <strong><font color="Orange">Fillet</font></strong> value you will go from the sharp to the round sides box
If you want a chanfered box, set <strong><font color="Orange">Resolution</font></strong> to 1.

To export each single piece, just set the other elements to <strong><font color="Orange">No</font></strong> value.
The Top and Bottom Shells are the same, 
so it's not necessary to export them two times, except if you use the PCB feet option.

Check the animation below to see how to design your own box.

You can change the text shape with any <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts"> font listed here </a>.

Have fun ;)

- Feb 12 2016
Minor bug fixed on unaligned hole when using more than 2mm thickness.
- March 01 2016
Added the decoration/holes options. (Thanks <a  href="http://www.thingiverse.com/Ettie">Ettie</a> for your contribution)
- March 09 2016
Added PCB feet support, fixed the shell artefact on export mode. 

- March 01 2018
 <strong><font color="Red">It Seems, since few month the online customizer doesn't works, some lib missing. it's not under my hands, ask to makerbot/thingiverse staff.
THE solution is, 
downloading the newest - Development Snapshot - release of Openscad software 
and activate in the Edit>preference>features menu 
and check the "Enable customizer" option.</font></strong> <br>link:
<a  href="http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots">OpenScad-Customizer</a>

<br><b>
<b>Please, read as well.
The PCB feet dimensions are all starting from the foot axis center.
it's not the circuit board size, holes center only(!)

# How I Designed This

## <strong><font color="Orange">Overview & Background:</font></strong>

</br>
The technology called, Stereolithography exists since the 80s.
It allow you to design anything with a monomer polymerization, by deposition of successive layers. 
It's at the origin of our FDM printers, developed it's been 20 years.
The STL file format was developed for stereolithography.

Why are we fascinated by this technology?
Because we are witnesses and participants of an industrial revolution.
A total change in the economic paradigm that has developed during the 19 and 20 th century.
We become craftsmen, designers, and take in hand our evolution.

Why am I talking about that?
I think it's a good introduction to show you a perfect demonstration of what we expect from this technology.

Design and answer to their own needs.
The proposed application lets you quickly create a case whose use will be defined by the user, the shape and dimensions will be those you have identified and not that the industry proposes / imposes.

## <strong><font color="Orange">Objective:</font></strong>

</br>
The student will have two objectives with a project like this one:

 - Create an application that will be used for future projects , and definitively avoid buying boxes not always appropriate to the needs .

- Learn programming by a quasi - recreational way , since entirely graphic and visual .

- Many other knowledge can be transmitted based on the desire of the teacher to deepen a particular aspect of the design .

## <strong><font color="Orange">Audience</font></strong>

</br>
I'm not familiar with the foreign school grades, 
in France, it's around 10/12 years old they begin to learn programming.
So, it can be a nice starting way and support project to learn visually to code.

The presented project was made in two times, 
I did the box in the first time, 
then I dug more, for the Panel Maker.

Like I said in the begining, I was, myself, learning how OpenScad works,
that will be the same for the students, learning and creating something more complex lesson after lesson. A perfect way to evaluate the level reached.

As an assessment



## <strong><font color="Orange">Skill learned</font></strong>

</br>
- Programmation
- 3D design
- 3D printing

## <strong><font color="Orange">Duration:</font></strong>

</br>
A project like this can be the string to follow throughout all the school year.

# Show me how it works...

</br>
Here is a small demonstration how to use the Customizer to have separate pieces box.
The top and bottom shells are the same, so it's not necessary to make 2 differents stl files.
If the front Panel is without text, then the back and front panels are the same, so again,
just export one.

Enjoy guys, and show us your printed boxes... ;)

# Experimental Area

## <strong><font color="Orange">With Panel Maker</font></strong>

This release include a panel maker.
fully working, just for the moment, I didn't find the good way to present it within the online customizer.
Not easy to make something easy to use...

Anyway, it stay easy to use, through Openscad. with few option, you will be able to create the panel that you need without limitation, or almost...
<br>
<img src="http://heartygfx.free.fr/Thingiverse/Experimental_Box.jpg">
<br><br><br>
<img src="http://heartygfx.free.fr/Thingiverse/Rendu 0002.png">
<br><br>

To build your own panel, you have 4 tools:

   <font size ="4">Cutting shapes</font>
* Square
* Circle

   <font size ="4">Text label</font>
* Linear text
* Circular text

SquareHole  (1,20,20,15,10,1); <font size ="2" color="Orange"> //(On/Off, Xpos,Ypos,Length,Width,Fillet)</font>
CylinderHole(1,27,40,8);       <font size ="2" color="Orange"> //(On/Off, Xpos, Ypos, Diameter)</font>

LText(1,20,83,"Arial Black",4,"Digital Screen"); <font size ="2" color="Orange"> //(On/Off, Xpos, Ypos, "Font", Size, "Text")</font>
CText(1,93,29,"Arial",4,10,180,0,"ABCD"); <font size ="2" color="Orange">//(On/Off, Xpos, Ypos, "Font", Size, Diameter, Arc(Deg), Starting Angle(Deg),"Text")</font>

You can download the animation and read it with the excellent <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gifviewer/">Gifviewer open source freeware</a>, to pause the animation when needed.
